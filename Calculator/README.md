# 🧮 Scientific Calculator - Python Tkinter

This is a **Graphical Scientific Calculator** built with **Python's Tkinter** library. It supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific functions like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `sqrt`, etc. The layout is scrollable to accommodate all buttons, and it includes a **backspace** feature to remove the last character.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Standard Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `()`
- ✅ Scientific Functions:
  - Trigonometry: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
  - Logarithmic: `log` (base 10), `ln` (natural)
  - Exponential: `exp`, `pow` (x²)
  - Square Root: `sqrt`
- ✅ Constants: `π`, `e`
- ✅ Control Functions:
  - `C` (Clear all input)
  - `⌫` (Backspace)
  - `=` (Evaluate expression)
- ✅ Scrollable interface (in case window size is limited)
- ✅ Keyboard-like layout with colorful buttons
